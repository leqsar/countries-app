## My process

### Estimated time

14 hours

### Actual time

20 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs-dev.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ru&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=sc)
- [Countries API](https://restcountries.com)

### What I learned

- Had some practice with computed properties and watchers

### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus on more elegant search and filter functions and especially on their combinations (right now this app have some bugs with simultaneous process of searching and filtering). So I want to give an Elastic search a try. Also I would like to try some beautiful day and night mode switching animations.
